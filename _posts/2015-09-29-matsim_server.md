With [MATSim](http://www.matsim.org), heavy dataset is a huge issue for running
simulation on a given computer, especially from a user machine. To prevent from
memory burst, MATSim Server is introduced, it is a stand alone application that
aims to be ran on a distant machine. Avoid using your personal machine resources,
and dispatch as many simulation as you want into a more powerful computing
machine through a RESTFull webservice. Binaries, sources and documentation can
be found on the project site below.
