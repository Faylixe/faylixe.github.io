Since May 2015, Google authentification protocol [ClientLogin](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/AuthForInstalledApps) is officially not supported anymore, which implies that the only command line tools for [Google Code Jam](https://code.google.com/codejam) contest is not working and deprecated. The Google Code Jam API aims to be a valid alternative to this obsolete client. Implemented in Java, it could be use by any application, or as a single command line application.
