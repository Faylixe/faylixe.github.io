[Marklet](https://github.com/Faylixe/marklet) is a custom **doclet** that generates a
javadoc using markdown format, which can be then directly be pushed to your code repository
on [GitHub](https://github.com) and be explored easily. Another great thing about such
generated content format, is that your javadoc weight on disk is smaller and faster to be
generated. Usage and samples are available on the following repository link.
