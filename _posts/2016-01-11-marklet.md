<br>

I don't like the standard javadoc rendering. When projects are too big, package and classes index are useless,
when project are too small either and the whole generated pages are too noisy when you don't have that much content.
This is how the idea of [Marklet](https://github.com/Faylixe/marklet) is born, a custom **doclet** that generates a
javadoc using markdown format, which can be then directly be pushed to your code repository on [GitHub](https://github.com)
and be explored easily. Another great thing about such generated content format, is that your javadoc weight on disk is smaller
and faster to be generated.
