<br/>

**Jammy** is a set of Eclipse plugin for managing Google Code Jam development.
Based on the previously developed [Google Code Jam API](http://faylixe.fr/2015/12/07/google_code_jam_client.html)
and currently in development, it supports following features :

* UI through a dedicated perpective including problem description, analysis, contest explorer or submission monitoring.
* Automatic submission.
* Test dataset extraction based on description example.

Basic plugin installation provides support for Java language only, but any
programming language could be supported, using the
[Addon API](https://github.com/Faylixe/jammy/wiki/Adding-language-support-to-Jammy).
